teenagers,[mod] Reminder of NSFW rules.,"Hey all,  


I hope everyone is well! My name is Josh and I'm the community director of r/teenagers. I've been a mod of the community of well over 2 years now, and combating predatory concerns has been an absolute must and a top priority from my time here. We are constantly finding new ways to reduce, and hopefully eradicate predation from not just our community, but a much wider picture than that.   


Keeping the users of this community is imperative in ensuring a healthy, safe but enjoyable place where teenagers from 13-19 can feel safe in a welcoming environment with no vulnerability. Since I came in, predation has significantly reduced- and before my time is up we'll constantly be finding new ways- even after my time has ended. For example, we recently developed a new bot, Osprey, working within the discord server that flags any potentially harmful content.  


Enough rambling (shut up josh- we've heard this before, you may be saying).

  
I'm writing this as to create a megathread for the community, as a general reminder of NSFW rules, due to a recent uptick in submissions of this nature. Before I continue, I must just put a disclaimer in the fact that NSFW submissions have always been a tricky thing to handle within r/teenagers. Many a conversation internally has been taken of outright removing all NSFW submissions- however this would be implosive within the community. We believe that discussion of strictly serious and non-anecdotal sexual education topics is incredibly healthy to discuss within the specific teenage demographic. It allows positive conversation about topics that may be uncomfortable to speak about with an adult- although that is 100% always promoted.  


Within this has tricky boundaries. As I've said previously, we have extremely strict NSFW rules that mean that:

1. Any topic discussed that has NSFW context must NEVER be anecdotal- it must always be a general discussion without personal relatedness within the conversation- even if its within the context of sex-education.

2. All topics regarding NSFW content should always be treated in a mature fashion and the NSFW tag. Any unserious comments within an NSFW submission will be removed.

3. Any stories regarding a fantasy character or anything of the likeness will also be removed.

  
Some people may believe these rules are too strict- however its absolutely imperative that the users of the community are kept safe from predation, and we have and will always ensure the safety of our users. We're just like you, every moderator is a teenager- we get it, people want to be silly, people want to make funny jokes- but when it comes to maintaining your cyber safety, we will always do everything in our power to ensure anything in our control keeps you safe- and you can do the same for your own benefit.

  
Thanks a bunch!

  
\-Josh and the r/teenagers moderation team :)",1582,1750112315.0,1ld6iqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ld6iqm/mod_reminder_of_nsfw_rules/
teenagers,Why are american teens getting so scared lol or is this karmafarm?,"Im from Punjab , a border area in India and few weeks from now there were missiles and drones flying over my head. By day 1 we were scared shitless , By day 2 we were calm but still afraid and By day 3 we were just enjoying the view because we had seen how capable our country's defense was . Iran is much weaker than Pakisthan and your defense is probably 20 times as strong as ours + you guys are like 2 continents away , whats with the freaking out. Russia is already pretty cooked so is not gonna get involved much . 

NO WW3 is gonna happen , there have been worse incidents in the past and no world war happened so stop freaking out and karma farm.",1519,1750604810.0,1lhq3cl,https://i.redd.it/4b7ek2l0uh8f1.png

teenagers,"Please, stop panicking","Ok the world is in shambles rn, and it's scary but panic just makes everything worse. After Russia invasion, a lot of us (ex-Soviet countries) were terrified. For months, I had anxiety, panic attacks, and couldn‚Äôt stop checking the news. I took meds for that and kinda backfired.¬†I learned from it and so here‚Äôs my tips to stay calm when the world feels too scary:¬†  
  
1. Understand the targets. Today's conflicts focus on infrastructures.  

2. You‚Äôre not getting dragged. Countries have armies for that. Civilians are supposed to keep life going. If we all freeze in fear, society can collapse just by that.  

3. Limit exposure to medias. They need sensational headlines and alarmist echo-chambers.

4. The world is more interconnected than ever. It‚Äôs in no one‚Äôs interest or benefit to go that far.  

5. Focus on what you can control. If something does break out, trust that professionals are managing the situation and do your best to live normally.  

6. If you need to talk, find the right place. There are subs for that.",1543,1750559106.0,1lhd6an,https://i.redd.it/5yc6n2rn2e8f1.png

teenagers,My step dad committed suicide today,"He was a prison guard at a medium security prison. I've heard that people in this line of work can have mental problems, but no one in my family expected this.

He left behind me, my two little brothers who are five and two, and my mom. Our family members have offered lots of help, and we're gonna be fine for now.

My mom woke me up at 8am this morning to tell me. After that, me, my mom, my little brothers, and two of my aunts went over to my grandma's house to tell her.

We've been talking to most of the family over the course of today, and most of the people from his side of the family have come over to my house. Hell, my aunt (his sister) who lives in Utah drove out to my house (I live in California) and she just got here.

A couple of my cousins are here, and right now we're all trying to distract ourselves right now. It's midnight and we're playing games, I'm watching YouTube and writing this. I'm not sure what we're gonna do next, but we'll probably deal with this more in the morning. I might make an update if anyone even cares about this.

I'm not sure how to feel. I didn't dislike my stepdad, but I didn't exactly like him. He got annoyed easily (especially with me) and he was a trump voter, so not the best person, but still a member of our family. I haven't cried yet, I've just... been going along with everything so far today. Im not exactly sure how to feel right now. If anything, im much more concerned about my mom and the future than my own feelings right now.

I'm gonna log off and go to bed after I post this, so I'll reply and look at comments in about eight or nine hours.

Everyone has problems, even adults. As much as your parents need to be there for you, you need to be there for your parents. Parents are people too, they also have mental struggles just like you.",558,1750577132.0,1lhi3yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lhi3yx/my_step_dad_committed_suicide_today/

I know he had a moment of being hated a few years ago for some social media posts and general behavior of his, but the ones I'm seeing lately are about the quality of his movies.

Here's what I know. He's directed an outstanding movie series with Guardians of the Galaxy, he made an improved version of Suicide Squad, and I thought his Peacemaker spinoff series turned out well also. I've been pretty OOTL on the superhero genre since then though (and really movies in general), but I know he's making the new Superman movie. Ever since that got announced, it feels like I'm seeing a bunch of revisionist history claiming he's never made anything good (one example cited below), so what's the deal?

You'll notice how there's these two videos called [More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfHY26ZnYj4&list=PLbgZLBgUwhqtP1ZYzB0OmdoQKETN26BCV&index=4) and [Unreleased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE-qy8HIx30&list=PLbgZLBgUwhqtP1ZYzB0OmdoQKETN26BCV&index=8), which are absolutely not part of the album. I have personally noticed these appearing in multiple different album playlists and it looks like a lot of people have also ended up there some way, seeing the view count and the ridiculous comment section.

These are just so weird. They consist of practically an hour of looped audio of a woman (sounds like a real person) reading out a presentation about some online commerce/crypto thing over a single static image. 

Both videos' descriptions seem like they'd relate to compilations of unreleased creative works of some kind, probably music going from the thumbnail and the channel descriptions. Weirdly, the ""Mentioned people"" section of the description has some names: *More* has Andreas Antonopoulos and both videos have Gary W. Keller. Both seem to be fairly renowned business people, according to Google. I haven't actually sat down and listened to the videos long enough to check if they were actually mentioned or not.

The last weird bit I've noticed are the uploaders. They're different channels, oddly enough, but their channel descriptions are extremely similar. Both have one or two other videos, all of which are very high view count music videos in Spanish and Indonesian respectively.

I am honestly so confused at these. My guess is that it's some very odd scheme to farm viewing time off of people having music playlists in the background, but why is the content so odd? What are these channels? What is this advertising, if anything? How did they get them to appear in playlists like this, whereas I've never even once in my life seen an ad video be inserted into a playlist by YouTube before? Just why why why?

The fact that these just suddenly appeared one day and millions of people have come across them yet we don't know what they are nor have they been fixed is one more drop in the bucket of things that make YouTube and its algorithms appear like some kind of unknowable alien entity we would've found in the depths of the Bermuda Triangle and just decided to build a society around, which is both kind of fascinating and extremely irksome.",13,1750249376.0,1lefp14,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1lefp14/whats_the_deal_with_these_two_specific_weird/

linguistics,The Illusion of Objectivity: How Language Constructs Authority,"Peer reviewed.

Abstract

This chapter investigates the grammatical and pragmatic strategies by which institutional discourse creates an illusion of objectivity to legitimize authority. It explores how agentless passives, impersonal constructions, and modal expressions (e.g., ‚Äúit must be done‚Äù) obscure authorship and intention, projecting necessity and neutrality. Far from being ideologically neutral, such linguistic forms restrict interpretive possibilities and reinforce epistemic closure. Drawing on systemic functional linguistics and pragmatic theory, the analysis is supported by examples from legal, academic, and religious discourse. The chapter contributes to a broader understanding of how language functions as a vehicle for institutional power and discursive control.

linguistics,Statistical support for Indo-Uralic?,"In this paper, Alexei S. Kassian, Mikhail Zhivlov, and George Starostin used a statistical method to test the Indo-Uralic hypothesis, that Indo-European and Uralic have recognizable common ancestry.

To try to avoid borrowings, they used some words that tend to resist being borrowed, in particular, a 50-word Swadesh list.

To compare word forms, they used a simplified phonology with only consonants and with different voicings and other such variations lumped together. Thus, s, z, sh, and zh became S. They used two versions, a more-lumped and a less-lumped version (s and ts lumped or split, likewise for r and l).

To estimate the probability of coincidence, they repeatedly scrambled their word lists and counted how many matches. More-lumped peaked at 2 and 3, less-lumped at 2.

They found 7 matches:

* ""to hear"": IE \*klew- \~ U \*kuwli
* ""I"": IE \*me \~ U \*min
* ""name"": IE \*nomn \~ U \*nimi
* ""thou"": IE \*ti \~ U \*tin
* ""water"": IE \*wed- \~ U \*weti
* ""who"": \*kwi- \~ U \*ku
* ""to drink"": IE \*egwh- \~ U \*igxi-

(gx is a voiced ""kh"" fricative)

Comparing to the scrambled word lists, the probability of 7 or more matches is 1.9% for the more-lumped consonants, and 0.5% for the less-lumped consonants.

The authors addressed the possibility of borrowing, since the Uralic languages have many premodern borrowings from Indo-European ones. They consider it very unlikely, since 4 out of the 7 matches are in the top 10 of stability: ""I"", ""thou"", ""who"", ""name"". That's 40% preserved, as opposed to 7.5% preserved of the next 40 words.

So they conclude that Indo-European and Uralic have recognizable common ancestry.",39,1748645234.0,1kzhuhq,https://www.academia.edu/18952423/Proto_Indo_European_Uralic_comparison_from_the_probabilistic_point_of_view_JIES_43_2015_

linguistics,How can we best overcome factors that inhibit the usage of non-dominant languages on the Internet?,"Even when somebody does post in a non-dominant language, e.g. English, other speakers typically don‚Äôt reply to or engage with the post.

This happens even among dominant languages with many speakers of other major languages preferring to post in English.

I have tried to think of why. I think one reason perhaps is that most of the popular media or content is in dominant languages. Additionally, it might be the case that some languages have barely any media that can be discussed. But not all discussions on social media are about books, shows, music etc. Many are about current affairs, sport and topical issues that could easily be discussed in the non-dominant language. But few people do this. This could also be because speakers of non-dominant languages could be part of online communities where the majority aren‚Äôt speakers of non-dominant languages. Perhaps some people aren‚Äôt aware of how to type in their language (but I doubt this plays a role in many cases).

Technology and the Internet aren‚Äôt everything. But an increasingly large amount of young people‚Äôs lives are spent online. If they can‚Äôt use non-dominant languages online, then the health of these languages may be negatively impacted as it is youth who will pass on languages.

What do you think causes this phenomenon and how do you think people could be encouraged to use other languages on the Internet? Do you think this phenomenon is worse on certain platforms or is it a problem across the board (I think it‚Äôs a universal issue)?

Some academics discuss this issue, for example in the attached paper, but don‚Äôt seem to touch on solutions very much.

linguistics,RIP Haj Ross,"Haj Ross, a thinker that contributed to the foundations of modern linguistics, passed away yesterday. 

If you are not steeped in the syntactic literature, you may not immediately recognize the name, John Robert Ross, better known as Haj, but you have undoubtedly felt his presence. As a rule of thumb, if something in linguistics has a fun name, there are good odds Haj coined the term. Some of the highlights include pied piping, islands, sluicing, and conspiracy (a phonology term!). Haj's seminal work on islands is still required reading in many syntax programs. 

Haj was infamous for showing up to a talk and producing a counter-example off the top of his head. He never even bothered to learn x-bar but once, in his 80s, he showed up to a formal MP talk involving pied piping, he clocked the formalisms on the spot and came up with a counter-example to the central claim off the top of his head (you must understand Haj was incredibly kind and did this in the most gentle fashion).

While he backed off his work on syntax during his tenure at UNT, he continued to do pioneering work in poetics and contributed to his lifelong collection of squibs. I once had a summer gig digitizing old Haj squibs from the early 70s and many of them would have been great dissertation projects. He had more ideas than 100 linguists could address in a lifetime. 

Haj's linguistics work was legendary but one of the things that makes him so special among the seminal figures in linguistics is his overwhelming reputation for kindness and patience. He was a champion of students and known to be generous with his time and endlessly patient. I enjoyed hundreds of visits to his home to learn about the mysteries of language at his kitchen table or have him fall asleep next to me on the couch while working through a manuscript or interrupting our theoretical discussion to watch two movies in a row, etc. 

  
Please share your Haj anecdotes here if you have them (mods feel free to remove this post if not appropriate but I figure there are likely some Haj fans on reddit). ",86,1747235494.0,1kmhnpk,https://ci.unt.edu/squibnet/haj-ross.html

linguistics,Phonemic Surprisal and Iconicity in Lexeme Processing,"Hi all,

I wanted to share our (Kilpatrick & Bundgaard-Nielsen) study just published in PLOS ONE that may be of interest to those working in psycholinguistics, phonology, and linguistic typology.

This two-part study examines how *phonemic surprisal*‚Äîthe information-theoretic unpredictability of adjacent phonemes‚Äîinteracts with *iconicity* in shaping language processing and development.

Key findings include:

* Words with high **average phonemic surprisal** are harder to process (slower reaction times, lower accuracy), but are better remembered in recognition tasks.
* **Iconic words** (e.g., *buzz*, *splash*) are processed more efficiently, even though they often contain high-surprisal phoneme sequences.
* Iconicity appears to *counteract* the usual effects of length on surprisal, suggesting iconic forms remain marked longer before transitioning into more arbitrary, phonotactically common forms‚Äîsupporting the *Iconic Treadmill Hypothesis* (Flaksman, 2017).
* The study uses **large-scale corpus** data (SUBTLEX-US + CMUdict) and cross-references it with pre-existing psycholinguistic datasets (e.g., MALD, ELP, AoA norms, memory recognition).

The paper contributes to our understanding of how cognitive load, processing economy, and phonotactic markedness shape language. It also situates phonemic surprisal as a potentially useful metric alongside more established measures like phonotactic probability and lexical frequency.

Would love to hear others‚Äô thoughts, especially regarding potential applications of bigram-level surprisal in phonology, acquisition research, or typological modeling.
